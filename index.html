        <div class="sum-text">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, 
          if not more so, in the company I joined. 
          I honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.</div>
        <div class="testimonial">‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. 
                                    I‚Äôve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the  best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I‚Äôve  successfully switched careers, 
                                    working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</div>

          <div class="sum-text-white">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</div>
          <div class="testimonial-white">‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as 
                                    a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!  ‚Äù</div>

The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention
